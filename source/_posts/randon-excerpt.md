<p>Not sure if it’s because it rained this afternoon,
but the air tonight feels especially fragrant.</p>

<br>

<p>It was already 7 PM when I left the office. The section chief is now used to seeing me still in the office at this time. Because of the pandemic, he understands that the company's flexible work hours don’t suit my needs, so he allows me to stay after work hours and wait until the rush hour is over before leaving.</p>

<p>For me now, commuting between 7 AM and leaving at 7 PM feels like the safest time.</p>

<p>But because of this, I’ve had the chance to observe who else usually stays late at the office. Apart from a few senior engineers from our department who occasionally work late, it’s just our section chief and the director of the entire R&D building. Even when I leave, they are still busy, and it’s like that every day.</p>

<p>I can understand the director — I’ve heard he’s a well-known workaholic in the industry. But our section chief puzzles me. There are nearly ten sections here, each with their own chief, and they all leave on time. From what I can see, it seems only our section chief is as busy and enthusiastic about work as the director.</p>

<p>The normally bustling Eslite underground mall around 7 or 8 PM now presents an unexpectedly empty scene at this hour.</p>

<p>My sister messaged me today. Normally, our chats are pretty casual, but they’ve never stopped. Sometimes we can pick up the same topic after almost a month without contact.</p>

<p>It’s similar with my brother. Although I share more with my sister, I don’t know much about her personal life. Some of us in the family are like that; once we move out and live on our own, it’s as if we start to establish our own space and connections, becoming almost completely independent from the family.</p>

<p>I told my sister that it might take about three to five years before I go back to Kaohsiung, but she’s right; by then, I might have my own social circle in Taipei and be used to life here. So I might not be able to just let go easily.</p>

<p>However, looking at the rent I pay each month, I can’t help but think how nice it would be if that money were going towards my mortgage instead. Just this thought alone makes it hard to say whether I’ll miss it in three years.</p>

<p>When I got home just now and after exercising, I suddenly found myself looking at job openings in Kaohsiung. I really have no intention of changing jobs, since I still have a year and a half to gain full project experience. It’s only at that level that I’d feel ready to consider a job change.</p>

<p>It’s just that I suddenly felt homesick. Technically, Pingtung is my hometown, but for some reason, Kaohsiung feels more like home to me. Maybe it’s because my dad’s base is in Zuoying; from the time I was born until just before kindergarten, I was often taken to the military port to play with blocks and daydream.</p>

<p>We almost moved to Kaohsiung once, but for some reason, that plan fell through. I grew up in Pingtung City, but as I got older, I still found myself going to Kaohsiung whenever I had the chance.</p>

<p>Even the ads Facebook has been recommending to me these days are for developments in Kaohsiung. Sigh, the prices look tempting, but I wonder if they’ll still be the same in three years. Unless I focus on investing in my own skills, making myself worthy of a well-paying job when I return to Kaohsiung—that seems to be the only feasible and reliable way I can think of right now.</p>

<p>Since I left Taipei for the south at the end of 2017, until I started working at I-Shou University a couple of months later, I spent every afternoon at the tea restaurant on the top floor of Far Eastern Department Store, then wandered around the nearby Eslite until late before heading home. Looking back now, I feel a bit nostalgic. Although those aren’t exactly beautiful memories, I’m just feeling sentimental.</p>

<p>When I started working at I-Shou, I went back to that place to relive that feeling, but the tea restaurant had changed hands and turned into another shop. The decor and layout were completely different. The scenes from that time can only be cherished in my heart.</p>

<p>Let’s talk more about those days later. Right now, I just want to take a shower and carry my nostalgia for the past along with my expectations for the future.</p>

<br>

<p>I want to get a good night’s sleep.</p>
