<p>yesterday, after playing with friends at a store until it closed, we all went to a night market nearby for dinner. It was my first time there actually.</p>

<p>A few years ago, when I lived near that area, I never visited because I didn’t like going to crowded places for no reason. I ended up living there for an entire year without ever going.</p>

<p>This reminded me of a story.</p>

<p>The last time I went to a night market was two years ago, with a friend I had known since childhood. I always felt like our relationship was a bit strange, but we never really got closer.</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, we didn’t see each other again, but we still remembered each other’s birthdays every year. So we’d contact each other at least twice a year, keeping this relationship that was both familiar and distant.</p>

<p>Two years ago, when I had just moved to Dashe, she happened to be living in Kaohsiung.</p>

<p>So after ten years, we met again.</p>

<p>We met up a few more times after that, though there was a bit of awkwardness since we hadn’t seen each other for so long.</p>

<p>But overall, it was pleasant. We had good conversations, talking about work, plans for the future, gossip about old classmates, or just random things.</p>

<p>Apart from not agreeing on having kids, we shared similar values in most things. Even when it came to raising kids, we both felt that teaching them ourselves was better than sending them to cram school, which would just waste money and time (though I personally think it’s best to not have kids and just enjoy life forever).</p>

<p>It felt like she’d be the kind of person you could live with comfortably.</p>

<p>But I just didn’t feel that spark.</p>

<p>There were several times I tried to convince myself to spend more time with her, to take the initiative.</p>

<p>She always responded positively, but every time I tried to take a step forward, something in my heart, like an invisible line, held me back.</p>

<p>That so-called ‘intention’ was just me forcing it.</p>

<br>

>‘Let’s meet again before I head to Taipei,’ 
>
>‘Okay,’ 

<br>


<p>I don’t even know why I made that suggestion. Maybe I just wanted to give it another try.</p>

<p>But last year, when I was leaving school, I was too busy with job transitions to think much about her. Then more things happened, and I was both busy and a bit down. I didn’t have the energy to think about relationships.</p>

<p>By the time I was actually going to Taipei, we hadn’t met again.</p>

<br>

<p>There was no need.</p>

<p>She had found someone else.</p>

<br>

<p>I felt relieved, like I’d finally let go of something uncertain. I was happy for her, too. For someone like her, with good qualities both inside and out, it was about time she made a decision after being single for so many years.</p>

<p>Now we’re back to the way things used to be, only remembering each other’s birthdays. She’s once again that familiar yet distant person.</p>

<p>A relationship that had just begun was now over, and we returned to the same old cycle. There was a bit of regret, but no lingering feelings. In that moment, I realized that I had never truly invested myself. She probably sensed my detachment as well.</p>

<p>When I observe someone, I never pay much attention to what they say they are, what they claim to think, or what their intentions are.</p>

<p>I only look at what they actually do.</p>

<p>I use the same standard and attitude to examine myself. The feelings and behavior that should accompany truly liking someone never happened with her.</p>

<br>

<p>Well, actually, I never really liked her, though.</p>

<br>

<p>Looking back now, I realize that during such a major turning point in my life, I wasn’t in any position to give her anything. Forcing it would probably have only caused more problems.</p>
